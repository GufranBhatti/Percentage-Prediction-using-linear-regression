# Percentage-Prediction-using-linear-regression
This is my task 01 of internship at The Sparks Foundation where on the basis of hours studied I need to predict the score of that student. By using linear regression I
trained my model, after that I predicted if a student studies for 9.25 hours how much he/she will score.
